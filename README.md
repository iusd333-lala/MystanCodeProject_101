# MystanCodeProject_101
### This repository holds my programming projects done during the period of stanCode SC101 course.

### Project Source Codes:
1. [my_drawing](https://github.com/iusd333-lala/MystanCodeProject_101/blob/main/stanCode_Projects101/my_drawing/my_drawing.py)
   - a Python-based graphical project that draws Mickey Mouse using the `campy` graphics library.
   - a practical demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, illustrating how to use classes and objects to create complex visual elements.

2. [break_out_game](https://github.com/iusd333-lala/MystanCodeProject_101/blob/main/stanCode_Projects101/break_out_game/breakout.py)
   - an interactive Python implementation of the classic game, Breakout
   - using the `campy` graphics library, it is an advanced practice in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - The project deliberately separates the graphical interface and event handling from the core game loop to demonstrate clean, modular code design.
   
3. [my_photoshop](https://github.com/iusd333-lala/MystanCodeProject_101/blob/main/stanCode_Projects101/my_photoshop/stanCodoshop.py)
   - This Python project processes a sequence of photos taken of the same scene and automatically removes objects—like moving people, animals, or vehicles.
   - By comparing the pixels across multiple images, the algorithm identifies the static background and filters out anything that is only temporarily in the frame, producing a clean, empty scene.
   
4. [name_searching_system](https://github.com/iusd333-lala/MystanCodeProject_101/blob/main/stanCode_Projects101/name_searching_system/babygraphics.py)
   - an end-to-end data pipeline and visualization tool built in Python
   - act as both a back-end data collector and a front-end graphical interface
   - The algorithm scrapes historical baby name data directly from the Social Security Administration (SSA) website and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to search and visualize the popularity of specific names over the past century.
